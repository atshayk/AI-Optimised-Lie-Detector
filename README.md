# AI-Optimised-Lie-Detector
This project optimises existing lie detector classifier models using Genetic Algorithms, boosting performance anywhere from 2% to 10% depending on the model.

Original project title is "Optimized Lie Detectors using Genetic Algorithm for Classifier Selection in Multi-Level Ensemble Models"

I will do my best to make the documentation here and attach the research papers that have helped in the development of this project.

This repo will be featured on [my blog](https://atshayk.blogspot.com) where I will explain it in more detail!
